/* Primary result struct. Denotes either success or failure of a routine.
   Success is considered a no-op in most cases, and errors are handled in different
   ways depending on the context and severity.

   Errors have two main escape routes:
      - Fatal errors cannot be recovered from. The most serious of errors will
        display themselves on-screen, and then a fixed-length delay will happen
        before exiting. This is because we need to handle cases where the
        controller is not initialized, as this prevents us from reading the
        controller in order to, for example, support pressing A to exit etc.
        Some examples of fatal errors include failure to initialise SD card,
        failure to initialise DVD drive, can't init controllers, etc.

      - Normal errors are errors that can be recovered from. When a normal error
        occurs, the user is displayed an error prompt which they can dismiss.
        Some examples include failure to download updates, failed to save settings
        etc.
        It is implementation defined exactly what happens when a normal error occurs.
        See `rrc_result_error_check_error_normal' for details.

    This result struct should rarely (or never) be interfaced with directly.
    Instead, use the plethora of helper functions in order to process and handle
    errors. For example, to check for error and react accordingly, call the
    functions `rrc_result_check_error_fatal' or `rrc_error_check_error_normal',
    depending on the context of the error condition. For example, early stage
    SD card failure would use the former function. See their documentaton for
    more details.

    Result structs can be created with `rrc_result_create_*' (depending on source).
    Result structures are designed to be stack-allocated (i.e., not using `malloc').
