    Initialises the main GUI.

    The GUI is comprised of two parts: a console, and a banner artwork which surrounds it.
    This routine initialises and displays both.

    Note that this routine should only ever be called once: subsequent draws of either
    component should be done using other available routines.

    The created framebuffer is returned in `xfb'. Set `sys_stdio_report' to `true' to
    enable stdio reporting; this can be used, for example, to redirect printf calls to
    Dolphin logs.
